Measuring misalignment: Latest estimates for the chinese yuan
http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~mchinn/CCF_VoxEU_final.pdf

Few phrases in open economy macroeconomics excite so much attention, but elicit so little
understanding, as “currency misalignment”. The reason for this state of affairs is not very
difficult to understand: each different observer uses the phrase in a different way, incorporating
different models and different assumptions. No episode in recent history validates this thesis
better than the past decade’s debate over the Chinese yuan’s appropriate valuation.
In this chapter, we re-orient the discussion of currency misalignment back toward theory
and empirics; in particular, we set forth a typology of modeling approaches used to assess
misalignment, in order to highlight the difficulties in defining the “equilibrium (real) exchange
rate” in theory, and in quantifying the extent of deviations from equilibrium in practice. We then
recap recent estimates of yuan misalignment.
