#1: Should China Appreciate the Yuan (2004)
http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=527902

A little logic and a little evidence does not warrant the conclusion 
that the yuan should be appreciated. There has been no depreciation of 
the yuan in recent years to generate increases in China's exports and 
the total of China's and Hong Kong's exports to the U.S. has remained 
virtually constant. Nor does the U.S./China bilateral trade deficit, 
itself, reveal an undervalued yuan. China's exports to the U.S. are due 
to U.S. economic growth and, until recently, the effects of the 
euro/dollar rate in directing exports to the U.S. It is possible that 
China's exchange rate is below its optimal value as its foreign exchange 
reserves are quite large. Yet it would be understandable if the Chinese 
authorities were concerned about the potential volatilities of a 
floating exchange and of international capital markets and want to 
self-insure by maintaining large reserves.

#2: Measuring Misalignment: Latest Estimates for the Chinese Yuan (2010)
http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~mchinn/CCF_VoxEU_final.pdf

Few phrases in open economy macroeconomics excite so much attention, but elicit so little
understanding, as “currency misalignment”. The reason for this state of affairs is not very
difficult to understand: each different observer uses the phrase in a different way, incorporating
different models and different assumptions. No episode in recent history validates this thesis
better than the past decade’s debate over the Chinese yuan’s appropriate valuation.
In this chapter, we re-orient the discussion of currency misalignment back toward theory
and empirics; in particular, we set forth a typology of modeling approaches used to assess
misalignment, in order to highlight the difficulties in defining the “equilibrium (real) exchange
rate” in theory, and in quantifying the extent of deviations from equilibrium in practice. We then
recap recent estimates of yuan misalignment.


#3: The US-Sino Currency Dispute: New Insights from Economics, Politics, 
and Law
http://www.voxeu.org/epubs/cepr-reports/us-sino-currency-dispute-new-insights-economics-politics-and-law

Thanks to deft diplomatic footwork, a US-China confrontation over the 
renminbi has been avoided. But the US Treasury has merely postponed the 
publication of its report on foreign currency manipulators, and the 
dispute may overshadow the G20 meetings in June and November. The 28 
short essays in this eBook provide the best available economic, legal, 
political, and geopolitical thinking on the causes and likely 
consequences of the dispute.


#4: Chinese Yuan after Chinese Exchange Rate System Reform (2006)
http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1749-124X.2006.00044.x/abstract

In this paper, the actual exchange rate policy conducted by the Chinese 
government after the Chinese exchange rate system reform on 21 July 2005 
is investigated. Also, the long-run effect is investigated, including 
the Balassa-Samuelson effect on the Chinese yuan. It was found that the 
Chinese government generated a statistically significant but small 
change in exchange rate policy during the sample period until 25 January 
2006. It was not identified that the Chinese monetary authority is 
adopting the currency basket system because the change is too small in 
the economic sense. It is indicated that the Chinese government should 
take account of the productivity growth of countries composing the 
currency basket in order to operate a currency basket regime.
