\section{Why is this important?}

Chinese trade has increased four times over the last decade in terms of 
total global trade. This increase has been driven by the increased 
exports which by now far surpass China's imports.
China has been accused of artificially aiding these exports by 
manipulating the exchange rate of the Renminbi. By keeping the value of 
the Renminbi low, it becomes cheaper for western markets to buy Chinese 
goods, and more difficult to sell products on the Chinese market.
This accusation as become one of the major diplomatic issues between the 
United States and China during the last 10 years. In the political 
discourse US politicians are accusing China of stealing American jobs on 
unfair terms, while the Chinese administration claims that the RMB is 
not artificially undervalued.  Each use economic arguments to defend 
their claim, and this usage of economic theory in diplomatic discourse 
shed light on the practical value of the field of economics in economic 
diplomacy.

\section{What are we going to do about it?}

We intent to illuminating this issues by exploring how the economic 
argument is presented in academic discourse from both sides. Instead of 
entering the academic economic debate we will try to convey the economic 
theories in a clear and simple manner meant for a reader without any 
background in economic theory.  

With the economic argumentation in mind we explore the resulting 
political discourse and analyse how this discourse is connected with the 
underlying economic theory.  Based on these observations we will try to 
judge the validity of the stances both for and against the RMB and 
discuss how the economic theories influence the decisions. Are the 
politicians well informed in their argumentation or do they use 
economics purely as guise for a political agenda?

\section{How are we attempting to accomplish this?}

By analyzing academic literature arguing for and against an artificial 
depreciation of the RMB and holding these arguments up against 
statements made in official speeches by politicians we hope to make 
clear how the economic theory corresponds with diplomatic practice.

\section{Structure}

- Introduction: We contextualize the theme and frame the research 
question, and outline the methods used in the report.

- Economics 101: What are the basic models and theories that come in to 
play when we talk about appreciation of the RMB?

- Applied Economics: Within this basic framework we will flesh out the 
arguments made for and against the appreciation of the RMB in the 
academic discourse.

% In between we have people like Krugman who spearheads the political 
% discourse while being an economist
- The political debate: China has seen heavy criticized by the United 
States during the last decade. We would like to highlight the arguments 
used by both sides in the diplomatic debate, with a special attention on 
who is saying what.

- Discussion of economic arguments: Based on the academic discussion on 
the issue we intent to discuss the merit of the different viewpoints and 
what part of economics are used by either side.

%- Discussion of political arguments: 
%
- Discussion of political use of economics: We intent to discuss how 
politicians are making use of economic arguments and try to use 
knowledge of economics and common sense to judge if they have any root 
in reality.

- Conclusion:
