  abstract={The value of China's currency, the renminbi (RMB), and the conduct of China's exchange rate policy have generated intense debate in academic and international policy circles. Despite the accumulation of empirical evidence regarding the degree of RMB misalignment over the past few years, the debate continues unabated. In this study, we highlight the challenges to properly assessing the nature and degree of currency misalignment, in terms of the choice of the model, the method of calculation, and data uncertainty. In particular, we demonstrate the susceptibility of misalignment estimates to model selection and data revisions. Further, we explicitly discuss the implications of sampling uncertainty for determining the extent of RMB misalignment.},

The challenges touched upon here are issues such as the aftermath of the 2008-2009 global financial crisis, guarding the multilateral system, the decreasing power of the Netherlands, and securing food and raw materials. Solutions to these challenges can be found in increasing our understanding of our new partners and using economic diplomacy more frequently in an intelligent way.",
