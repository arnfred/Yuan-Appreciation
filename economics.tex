\section{economics}

%\subsection{world market} basic idea: prices of goods. exports and imports. trade balances. current account. financial account. they depend on the following factors: x, y, z. one of these factors is the exchange rate. or: surplus would tend towards zero through the mechanism of currency appreciation (?)

% The other story:
% Let's take a look at the financial account and the current account.  
% The financial acocunt is the investments (capital) flowing in and out 
% of a country while the current account constitutes the trade balance, 
% earnings on foreign investments and cash flows (e.g. remittences).

% Per definition these two accounts balance each other in the sense that 
% if a nation has a trade deficit causing their current account to be 
% negative, the government would have to borrow money or in other words 
% let foreign governments invest in their bonds, creating a financial 
% account surplus.

% China in particular has both a trade surplus and a lot of foreign 
% investment. This leads to an advantagous situation where the National 
% Bank of China ends up with a lot of foreign currency from people 
% buying RMB to buy chinese products or construct factories in China.

% Many of the dollars that are bought by the National Bank of China are 
% reinvested into US state bonds, in effect enabling the US to keep 
% their budget deficit running.

% When the Chinese National Bank sells RMB to investors and trading 
% partners, they are in a sense free to decide how many dollars you 
% would need to buy 10 RMB. However, deciding on the exchange rate has 
% far reaching consequences that we'll get back to.

% Now, what decides the price of a product sold by a company in one 
% country to a company in another?

% 

% The third story:

% How about the following outline:
% Introduce the economy of a country like in Krugman's book as a company 
% investing money and having expenses. Explain the concepts of current 
% account and financial account in terms of these down to earth company 
% expenditures and incomes and differentiate the concepts by outlining 
% how the financial account are items that generate income while the 
% current account are items that don't.

% With this in place transplant the analogy to a country and demonstrate 
% how the different aspects map on to the economics of a country.  
% Introduce why the current account + financial account = 0 and explain 
% intuitively why that is true.

% Of course things don't work in a country like they work for a company, 
% so let's flesh out how different elements of the expenditures and 
% incomes work in a country. In particular explain how:
% - How trade between to companies in different countries work

%	hold of Danish kroners to pay the Danish farmers first. To get 
%	Danish kroners, they would buy them on the currency exchange where 
%	they would originate from Danish Banks. ...(stop here?) The Danish 
%	Banks in turn get their supply of Danish Kroners from the National 
%	Bank of Denmark. In Denmark the National Bank have decided to peg

%	[ Foreign investment comes in many shapes and forms. The most

\subsection{The story of two companies}

Let MingFix by a Chinese company and Fluttr an American company. MingFix 
produces porcelain fixtures and Fluttr mass manufactures pop art. Based 
on a very successful prototype, Fluttr has decided to massproduce 250000 
miniature christmas trees made in parts with porcelain fixtures and in 
their search for a supplier they've come across MingFix who can produce 
fixtures at a rate much cheaper than american companies producing 
similar products.  A contract is signed and Fluttr owes MingFix the net 
sum of 23 million RMB. However, Fluttr being an american company will 
have to exchange their dollars to RMB to fulfil their part of the 
contract, something they do by selling their dollars to a chinese bank.

For most other currencies it's possible to easily exchange large amounts 
of money on a currency exchange where the price of the currency 
fluctuates with the demand and supply. However China retains strict 
control over the access to RMB and leverages full control over the value 
of RMB per Dollar. Currently the RMB is pegged at a fixed rate to the US 
dollar.  This means that the exchange rate between the two economies 
remains constant over time at 6.24RMB per Dollar. This makes it easy for 
MingFix to sign the contract with Fluttr since none of them need to 
worry about fluctuations in the exchange rate, and for both Fluttr and 
MingFix this is an advantage as long as the Chinese national bank sells 
the RMB for a relatively Cheap price. For Fluttr it's advantegous 
because a good exchange rate makes the porcelain fixtures cheaper for 
them to buy, and MingFix benefits because it increases their ability to 
compete on an international market as long as they aren't reliant on 
importing products from the US.

The dollars from the transaction ends up in the hands of the People's 
Bank of China who aren't interested in keeping the money as is, since it 
doesn't give them any interests and constantly loses value due to 
american inflation. Some of the dollars are sold to Chinese buyers. Some 
are invested in Chinese projects around the world, but a big chunk of 
them are put in US federal bonds. These bonds are issued by the US 
Federal Bank to cover for the trade deficit. From an american viewpoint 
the bonds are a way to borrow money while they to the Chinese is a 
secure way to store their american Dollars. Usually the bonds will yield 
a bit of interest and since they are issued by a nation that is very 
unlikely to default on its payments it is a very secure way of store the 
dollars.

The christmas trees were a great succes and Fluttr are looking into out 
sourcing the production and decides to invest in Chinese factory 
facilities in partnership with MingFix. To start production they invest 
42 mllion RMB in China in the form of wages, land rent, buildings 
machinery and laywers typing up contracts.  This money is based on 
Dollars as before, and again the People's bank of China steps in to sell 
RMB to Fluttr for their Dollars.  Both Fluttr and MingFix benefit from a 
cheap exchange rate once again, since this gives them more value for 
their money on Chinese soil.

Half a year down the road Fluttr starts to see their market shares in 
porcelain christmas trees diminishing due to a new Chinese competitor 
calling themselves Flittle and selling similar products for much 
cheaper.  While the Dollar RMB exchange rate original benefitted Fluttr, 
they are now at a disadvantage by having large part of their design and 
administration working in the US. This makes their profit margins for 
each product sold much smaller than Flittle who benefits from a cheap 
exchange rate when they export their goods because the dollars their 
consumers pay are exchanged to RMB's at a beneficial rate.

Fluttr are forced to lay off a large part of their staff in the US as a 
response and since none of the executives are willing to relocate to 
China and start a new life there under better circumstances for their 
company, they instead spend their evenings writing angry letters to 
their senators pushing them to put pressure on China to increase the 
value of the RMB. They might have benefitted from the exchange rate for 
a while, they readily admit, but there is no way they can compete with 
an entirely Chinese company and they would much rather give up their 
collaboration with chinese suppliers than competing against chinese 
companies.

\subsection{A bit of analysis}


\subsection{foreign exchange market}

Money is a tradable good and different currencies can be traded against each other in the foreign exchange market. Market participants such as private persons, corporations, commercial banks and national banks can exchange a certain amount of a currency for another amount of another currency. The price of a currency A in terms of currency B is called the exchange rate of A and B. For example, as of october 28 2012, you get \textdollar{1.29} in exchange for \euro{1}. The exchange rate is determined by supply and demand for a currency. If at some point the demand for more US dollar rises, for example because a international corporation invests in the US and pays workers there a wage in US dollars, the price of the dollar on the currency market will be higher, i.e. you will get fewer US dollars for one euro.

In the currency market, national banks play a special role. In principle, each national bank has an unlimited supply of its own currency, because they can - figuratively speaking - print a discretionary amount of money in their own currency.\footnote{The process is somewhat more complicated than printing bank notes, but the effect is the same for the purposes of this section.} A national bank can therefore influence the exchange rate of its currency against other currencies. If the national bank of the US, the US Federal Reserve decides to print more US Dollars and uses them to buy euros, the price of the dollar in terms of euro depreciates, i.e. you will get more US dollars for one euro. This process is very common: Some national banks even use their money supply to `peg' their currency to another, so that exchange rates are fixed. For example, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) offers every vendor of an euro CHF 1.20 in exchange. Since the SNB controls the money supply of Switzerland, it will never run out of CHF and the exchange rate of the Swiss franc and the euro will therefore never be lower than 1.20 until the SNB changes its exchange rate policy. As another example, the national bank of Denmark controls the supply of Danish kronor so that the exchange rate of the kronor and the euro constantly remains at 0.134 (with a small bandwith of +/-2.25\%). 

Such practices seem to be accepted in public discourse and by the relevant multilateral agency, the International Monetary Fund. Meanwhile, China has been accused by prominent US politicians of `manipulating' its currency and keeping the Chinese currency, the Renminbi\footnote{abbreviated to CNY. The basic unit of the Renminbi is the Yuan.} `undervalued'. The next section will analyze how this alleged manipulation takes place and what it means for a currency to be undervalued. 

\subsection{nominal undervaluation, currency manipulation}

Macroeconomic theory postulates, that for every two currencies at every moment, there is an equilibrium exchange rate. The equilibrium exchange rate ist determined by supply and demand for each currency in the foreign exchange market. The accusation against China of `manipulating' its currency can therefore be restated: It claims that China is keeping a fixed exchange rate \emph{below} the equilibrium rate. According to textbook economics this can be done in three ways:\footnote{\cite[pp. 514]{Krugman2008}}

\begin{enumerate}
\item{The government can shift supply and demand for its currency by intervening on the foreign exchange market. Buying foreign exchange and selling the local currency drives the price of foreign exchange up and that of the local currency down.}
\item{The government can shift supply and demand by means of monetary policy, namely by keeping interest rates low. Lower interest rates mean lower returns for foreign investors. If foreign investors refrain from investing locally, the demand for the local currency decreases, driving the price of the local currency down.}
\item{The government can impose foreign exchange controls, forbidding foreigners to buy the local currency, therefore again reducing demand and therefore the price of that currency.}
\end{enumerate}

Why would a government do such things? Goods produced in a country with a low exchange rate are cheap relative to goods produced in other countries, since production costs are paid in the (low-valued) local currency. A low exchange rate therefore increases competitiveness of the export sector. 

%normally, the following would happen (Krugman pp. 507-509, and Humpage: http://www.clevelandfed.org/research/trends/2010/1110/01intmar.cfm)
% nominal undervaluation by selling RMB -> increase of RMB money supply -> inflation -> real (instead of nominal) RMB appreciation.
% but it does not happen because china "sterilizes" the money, does not let money supply increase

\subsection{China criticism}

But how do we know a currency is indeed undervalued? The postulated equilibrium interest rate is a virtual value not realized in the foreign exchange market and can not be measured. Indeed there is no reliable method to determine the `right' exchange rate of a currency.\footnote{among others: \cite{pp. 4}{GoldsteinLardy2008}}
%Purchasing power parity (PPP) would possibly be a method, but i have not seen it discussed in relation with China yet.

Critics of China therefore base their case on circumstantial evidence rather than on hard empirical methods. %\footnote{although such studies exist too, \cite{}???} 
According to their claims, China has been doing exactly what textbook economics tell us a government keeping its currency undervalued would do:\footnote{\cite[pp. 40]{GoldsteinLardy2008}}

\begin{itemize}
\item{The Chinese government has intevened on the foreign currency market on a massive scale: It has been buying foreign currencies, mainly US Dollars (in the form of US government debt) in exchange for RMB to the amount of 10\% of its GDP, i.e. 10\% of the value of all goods and services produced in China.} %show data. but first find data (IMF? FRED?)
\item{Interest rates in China are relatively low, with real (i.e. adjusted for inflation) interest rates actually being negative for the most part since 2006.} %show data. but first find data (World Bank?)
\item{China imposes foreign exchange controls that prevent international investors or other governments to buy RMB.}%this seems clear, but i have not yet found how they do it exactly
\end{itemize}

\emph{As a result}, critics of Chinas exchange rate regime would say, China's export sector has become extremely competitive. Indeed, China's exports exceed its imports by far; in absolute terms, such a current account surplus (i.e. the amount by which the value of exports exceed the value of imports) is unprecedented, though not so much in relative terms. %account surplus data is easily available. including switzerland might be fun, because the Swiss surplus is even higher. 

%is monetary policy used for normal goals (like controlling inflation) or is it used to manipulate the currency? for some countries these goals align (switzerland), but not so for china (inflation is high, and they still sell RMB)
